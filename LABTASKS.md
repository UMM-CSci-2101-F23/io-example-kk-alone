Tasks
-------------------------

For each task, complete the TODO. *Commit your changes after each task*, giving appropriate credit to all co-authors involved with the work and describing what was done. Change the word TODO to DONE in the comment for each TODO as you complete it, but be sure to leave the rest of the comment there. Push your changes to GitHub and submit a text entry for TODO #9 on Canvas after you have completed the rest of the lab.

To put co-authors in the commit, *leave a blank line* and then use the pattern: 
`Co-authored-by: Kristin Lamberty <lamberty@morris.umn.edu>` Where the email is the email associated with the GitHub account for a lab partner who is not logged in and each such co-author has this information on a new line.

The Maven commands you will likely use the most: `mvn clean jacoco:prepare-agent test jacoco:report`

-------------------------

TODO #1 (for outcome 4): Work together with your lab partner to provide some reflections about how you worked together as a team. 
 - [ ] What was something you did well that helped you work together? 
 - [ ] What was something you might do differently if you went back in time and did this lab again? 
 - [ ] What advice would you tell a team working on this lab in the future that might help them complete this lab? What particular resource or idea might help them with something that was a little confusing or new?
